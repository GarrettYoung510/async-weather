## Reasoning/Motivation

Built as a refresher on front end topics

## Technologies Used
* Vanilla JS (async & await, shorthand object notation, localStorage)
* Real DOM manipulation (updateUI using setAttribute, innerHTML)
* AccuWeather API 
* Bootstrap 

## Challenges

* Learning a new API, but AccuWeather has really good documentation
* Refresher making async and await calls to restful apis

## Next Steps

* Adding this to another application so that users can input there location and have their weather displayed
